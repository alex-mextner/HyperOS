# Consolidation Work Tracker

> The single consolidated handoff is **HANDOFF-MASTER.md** — start there. This tracker is the granular log.

Honest status of the full sol handoff (§1–13) plus the content plan. Not "almost done" — much remains.

## DONE
- §1 Full Foundation corpus imported to main (162 docs, diagrams, digests, atlases).
- §2 PDF/source provenance recorded (SHA-256, integrate-not-store; no binaries).
- §3 Stale positions fixed: name→AgentOS; **fork the entire Fuchsia tree** (corrected corruption); Linear dropped; Fuchsia/FEMU/Starnix framed as the chosen base + digest.
- §4 Single source of truth set (engineering-bible/docs/**); knowledge/ deprecated.
- §5 Validation: 158 IDs, 0 dup, 0 broken links; honest cyrillic accounting (0 in normative specs).
- §4/§5 Registers extracted to CSV: claims(34), experiments(51), sources(9), risks(323).
- Content plan: PROD-013 (offload), PROD-014 (clients), PROD-015 (voice), ARCH-021 (layered boot), ARCH-022 (capabilities), LEGAL-013 (threat model), HW-017/018/019 (demo brick), RES-011/012.
- Portal: four-audience front door (build/developers/investors/users); wiki reads canonical bible.
- Issues #25–#43 created + labeled.
- Handoffs written: Project v2 board, Vercel deploy.

## REMAINING — with owner

### Needs access I lack (HANDOFF to claude code / user)
- **Fuchsia first build + emulator** — container infeasible (1 core / 3GB RAM / 10GB disk vs ~90GB checkout). HANDOFF-fuchsia-first-build.md: SDK quickstart tonight (no build), full build overnight on x86-64 Linux VM/box; scripts/ ready. Build strategy is normative in ARCH-023.
- **§10 Project v2 board population** — token has no Projects permission. HANDOFF-project-v2-board.md.
- **§11 Portal write-back** (GitHub App/OAuth: create/edit issues, dates, PRs for wiki) — needs app credentials.
- **Vercel deploy + browser QA** — HANDOFF-vercel-portal-deploy.md.

### I CAN do (queued, in priority order)
1. ~~§12 License strategy~~ — DONE (LEGAL-014; Apache-2.0 default, CC BY docs, CERN-OHL hw, DCO, trademark policy).
2. **§7 Portal completeness** — PARTIAL: added /claims /experiments /sources /risks /glossary /decisions (from registers). STILL TODO: /procurement /contacts; per-doc TOC, backlinks, prev/next, provenance panel, cross-doc full-text search, Mermaid/image render polish, verify Edit-on-GitHub URLs.
3. **§8 Research-grade comparisons** — deep iOS/Android/AgentOS matrix (system object model, action APIs, agent authority, history, sandboxing, updates, privacy, offline…); detailed pages for Fuchsia/Zircon, seL4, Genode, Redox, postmarketOS, GrapheneOS, MINIX3, QNX, Haiku, Plan 9/Inferno, KeyKOS/EROS/CapROS, Tock, Hubris, Theseus, Barrelfish, HarmonyOS, App Intents/AppFunctions, Anytype, Automerge, Loro. Each claim sourced.
4. **§9 Hardware/device catalogue** — per-target matrix (role, quality ceiling, docs access, boot control, GPU, camera, modem, power, security, debug, firmware, legal route, cost, availability, replacement, go/no-go); local images+provenance for Pixel 9, Fairphone, PinePhone Pro, VIM3, i.MX 8M, RK3588, RISC-V, custom carrier, camera modules.
5. ~~English summaries of the 3 Russian atlases~~ — DONE (translated in place, not a separate summary; see HANDOFF-MASTER §2.4).
6. **§13 Final cleanup** — dedupe old copies, close superseded issues, README refresh, changelog, migration map.

## Notes
- Every push verifies main hasn't moved (fast-forward only).
- Run validation after each block (the cyrillic mis-report taught this).
