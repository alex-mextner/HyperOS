# HyperOS Bootstrap Plan

## Intent

Turn the empty repository skeleton into a spec-led Rust workspace without
starting subsystem implementation ahead of the architecture specs.

## Sequence

1. Land the system overview spec and tool governance setup.
2. Write `docs/specs/001-bootstrap-toolchain.md` with the Rust workspace shape,
   allowed cheap checks, and current build-status policy.
3. Add the root Cargo workspace and placeholder crates only after the toolchain
   spec exists.
4. Write the kernel, IPC, simulator, and UI composition specs in that order.
5. Add the first smoke tests only after the owning spec defines acceptance
   evidence.
6. Add a scheduled or CI-driven `haft check --json` gate once the CI surface
   exists, so expiring `valid_until` dates are reported before they go stale.

## Current Build Status

There is no runnable code and no Cargo workspace yet. Do not run `cargo build` or
`cargo test` until `001-bootstrap-toolchain.md` defines the workspace and build
status policy.

## Verification For This Plan

- `haft doctor` must pass with zero failed checks.
- `haft spec check` must pass before relying on Haft spec coverage or plan
  commands.
- `sverklo reindex . --timing` should complete.
- `serena project health-check` may report no analyzable files until Rust source
  files exist; that result is expected during this phase.

## Fresh Checkout Haft Baselines

Haft stores SpecSection baselines in the operator's local SQLite state, not in
git. After cloning or switching machines, run `haft sync`, review the active
sections in `.haft/specs/`, then approve the bootstrap sections locally:

```bash
haft spec onboard --approve TS.environment.001 --approved-by "$USER"
haft spec onboard --approve TS.role.001 --approved-by "$USER"
haft spec onboard --approve TS.boundary.001 --approved-by "$USER"
haft spec onboard --approve ES.repo.001 --approved-by "$USER"
```

Rerun `haft spec check --json` after approval.
