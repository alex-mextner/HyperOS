# HyperOS Pixel 9 Simulator Spec

## Status

Active follow-up spec for the simulator harness and device model. The simulator
is part of the product scope, not a disposable test helper.

## Purpose

The Pixel 9 form-factor simulator provides the observable runtime target for the
HyperOS MVP. It owns boot orchestration, display dimensions, input routing,
timing assumptions, and evidence capture.

The recovered source digest identifies FEMU as the source-faithful Fuchsia Track
A target and rejects a custom UI simulator as the final prototype target. This
spec is narrower: it defines the repository's bootstrap host simulator so early
Rust/product-layer work can produce repeatable evidence before FEMU setup and
full Fuchsia build constraints are resolved.

## MVP Scope

The MVP simulator includes:

- A Pixel 9 shaped display surface with stable logical dimensions and safe-area
  metadata.
- A boot entry point that starts the kernel and core services, invokes the
  app-launch/display registration path, and observes the first UI surface.
- Basic input events for touch/click and a minimal text/key path if the first
  shell needs it.
- Frame capture or screenshot evidence for the first displayed surface.
- Structured smoke-test output for boot success, first app launch, and IPC denial
  evidence.

The MVP simulator may be host-only and deterministic. It does not need Android
emulation, GPU acceleration, cellular behavior, camera, sensors, or hardware boot
support.

Real hardware work is intentionally out of this spec. `050-real-device-operation.md`
owns the later path from simulator evidence to hardware abstraction and device
bring-up.

## Full Maximum Plan

The maximum simulator plan adds:

- Multiple device profiles with Pixel 9 as the default acceptance target.
- Deterministic frame timing plus optional real-time rendering mode.
- Input replay for regression tests.
- Screenshot and trace artifact bundles for CI and agent review.
- Simulated power, suspend/resume, rotation, and display-density behavior.
- Optional sensor and network stubs once owned by later specs.

## Evidence Contract

Simulator evidence must be understandable without reading logs line by line:

- Boot result: pass/fail plus failure phase.
- Runtime milestones: kernel start, services ready, first app launched, first
  frame displayed.
- Security evidence: denied IPC/handle operation with expected reason.
- Visual evidence: screenshot or frame artifact for the first UI surface.

## Input Event Contract

MVP input events delivered from the simulator to the OS input path must be
structured records with:

- Timestamp.
- Event type.
- Logical display coordinates for pointer/touch input, with origin at the
  top-left of the Pixel 9 logical display surface.
- Key code and modifiers for key/text input when enabled.
- Target display profile metadata when needed for safe-area or density mapping.

Physical pixels and density-scaled values are metadata, not the primary
coordinate space, so future density changes do not alter the OS input contract.

## Simulator Control And Observation API Contract

The simulator is the external driver for MVP evidence. Its public control and
observation surface must include:

- A boot command or programmatic entry point that selects the Pixel 9 profile.
- Structured boot milestones for kernel start, core services ready, first app
  launch requested, first surface registered, and first frame observed.
- Structured failure phases for boot, app launch, display registration, input
  routing, and capability denial checks.
- A frame/screenshot artifact path for visual evidence.
- A narrow observation interface for kernel/service state needed by smoke tests;
  observation must not be required for product correctness.

## Acceptance Evidence

This spec is satisfied for MVP when:

- A simulator boot command is documented.
- A smoke run records boot and first-surface milestones.
- A frame/screenshot artifact shows the first shell or app.
- The simulator can surface at least one IPC/capability denial result.
