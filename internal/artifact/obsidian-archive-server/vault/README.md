# Agent OS Engineering Bible

This repository is a research-backed foundation for an owned microkernel operating system and entity-first personal computing environment. “Agent OS” is an internal descriptive working name; stable IDs use `AOS-*`.

## Non-Negotiable Model

- The project owns its Rust-first microkernel and native system contracts.
- Product and service layers are portable across board backends.
- Android and Linux are not general foundations. Their use is confined to bounded Pixel 9 evidence, extraction, recovery, or temporary adapter work with explicit replacement gates.
- QEMU and documented boards prove architecture and portability; Pixel 9 tests quality-ceiling feasibility; a future ODM/JDM device is anticipated but not assumed.
- Sources, claims, experiments, tasks, and decisions are traceable through stable IDs.

## Status

This is a foundation release: executable planning and normative direction, not a claim that the OS or hardware support already exists. Specialist review gates are explicit throughout the package.
