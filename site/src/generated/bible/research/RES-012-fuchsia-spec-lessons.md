# Lessons from the Fuchsia/Pixel-9 Custom-OS Specification (Prior Art)

> **The chosen software approach, specified in depth.** This 60-page document details the plan the programme committed to from the start: fork Fuchsia/Zircon and build the product layer on top. Zircon, DFv2, FIDL, Magma, and Starnix are taken as-is; the entity/agent product layer is written from scratch; hardware comes up on a separate track. The Pixel-9 *hardware* target has since been archived in favor of the demo brick (ADR-0007), but the Fuchsia-fork *software* approach is current, not superseded. Original illustrations are retained under `diagrams/prior-art-fuchsia-spec/` with provenance.

## Status and Provenance

Source: a founder-supplied 60-page engineering specification, "Custom Mobile OS Specification Based
on a Fuchsia/Zircon Fork · Pixel 9" (original title was in Russian; translated here) — the detailed
specification of the chosen fork-Fuchsia approach. SHA-256 and redistribution status recorded in `sources/provenance/PROVENANCE.md`. The binary is not redistributed (integrate-not-store); seven key illustrations are retained locally as prior art. This document is the English digest of its transferable, platform-independent content.

## The Reuse Taxonomy (carried forward)

Every module is classified by one of six statuses; the status sets the effort, the legal regime, and the risk. This is platform-independent and is the recommended lens for demo-brick modules too.

| Status | Meaning | When | Typical risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AS-IS | take ready-made unchanged | fits directly | low |
| WRAP | run existing in a wrapper/compat layer | Linux-form userspace not worth rewriting | medium (ABI) |
| PORT | move code/knowledge to our platform | RE knowledge exists under another framework | high (volume) |
| REVERSE | clean-room reverse engineering | closed interface, no open implementation | very high |
| FORK | fork and maintain a branch | need a divergent base | medium (maintenance) |
| FROM-SCRATCH | write new code | original functionality | scales with scope |

Applied to the demo brick, most hardware is AS-IS (pre-certified modules), drivers are PORT (from RP1/PiSP docs), the product layer is FROM-SCRATCH, and there is almost no REVERSE — which is precisely why the demo brick is faster than the Pixel-9 plan, where REVERSE dominated.

<a id="two-track"></a>

## The Two-Track Strategy (carried forward)

The central strategic decision transfers directly: decouple product from hardware into two parallel tracks with different risk profiles. Track A (product) is built and demonstrated in emulation now, delivering most of the vision with no hardware blockers; Track B (hardware) is the slower bring-up. They converge only at the end. For AgentOS this is the QEMU/simulator track (product, capability model, instant modes, entity/agent) running now, and the demo-brick hardware track proceeding in parallel — exactly the PLAN-018 lane structure.

<a id="decoupling"></a>

## Substrate / Platform / Shell Decoupling

Three horizons with explicit contracts so the product never depends on hardware: substrate (kernel, drivers, HAL, firmware), platform services (entity store, sync, history, integrations, camera/modem as services), and shell/UI. The contract between platform and substrate is stable typed interfaces, so the same product runs on a mock substrate in emulation and on real drivers on hardware without changes above the contract line. In AgentOS this is the IDL/type system (AOS-ARCH-005) plus the capability model (AOS-ARCH-022): the mock-substrate idea becomes the simulator target of AOS-DEMO-012.

<a id="entity"></a>

## Entity / Agent Data Model

The product core is a typed entity graph — nodes (person, project/task, document, event/place, message, device) with typed edges (participates-in, relates-to, derived-from) carrying time, source, and confidence — over which agents with scoped capabilities extract, deduplicate, and link entities and maintain a global history. Deduplication is reversible and auditable (false merges destroy trust). State is local-first with optional CRDT sync; the cloud is transport/backup, never the source of truth. This is the platform-independent heart of the product and aligns with the portable system architecture (AOS-ARCH-001) and the voice agent's typed-action model (AOS-PROD-015).

<a id="ceilings"></a>

## Camera and Telephony Ceilings (honest)

Two ceilings stated plainly in the source, both still true and already reflected in current docs:

- **Camera.** Open computational photography (HDR+ / Halide, libcamera) is real and portable, but the quality ceiling is manual per-sensor tuning (CCM, black level, noise profile, AWB/AE), not the algorithm. Result is "decent," not flagship, without closed tuning. This is the two-layer tuning-portability rule now in AOS-HW-018.
- **Telephony.** On the Pixel-9 plan, the modem was a black box requiring transport + boot-sequence + command-set reverse engineering, with voice the riskiest milestone. The demo brick sidesteps this entirely by using a pre-certified cellular module with a documented interface (AOS-HW-018) — a concrete example of choosing AS-IS over REVERSE.

<a id="legal"></a>

## Reverse-Engineering Legal Frame

Interoperability RE is broadly permitted: EU Software Directive Art. 6 (decompilation for interoperability), US DMCA §1201(f) exception. Safe practice is clean-room: one side observes and documents the hardware interface and writes a specification; another implements from the specification without seeing original code (how Panfrost/Freedreno were built). Firmware blobs are used as-is, never modified; radio behavior is never altered. This is consistent with AOS-LEGAL-003 and the hard rules of AOS-PROD-014, and it applies unchanged regardless of kernel choice.

<a id="precedents"></a>

## Precedent Lessons

- **Asahi Linux** — a small team reverse-engineering modern silicon takes years, and its key multiplier was targeting Linux, where the driver ecosystem exists. Targeting a bespoke stack on undocumented silicon is harder — which is why decoupling tracks is mandatory. (Reinforces the demo-brick choice: buy documented modules, don't reverse a flagship.)
- **Replicant / libsamsung-ipc** — years on one modem class, still not covering modern models: the modem is the most time-consuming block; live on data/SMS and treat voice as a risky milestone. (The demo brick avoids this via a pre-certified module.)
- **dahliaOS** — a real Fuchsia fork exists; the value is not the act of forking but what is built on it. (Confirms the approach: forking Fuchsia is feasible and done before; the value is the product and the bring-up on top, not the fork itself.)
- **postmarketOS / Megapixels** — open computational photography is real and portable, but the ceiling is sensor tuning, not the algorithm; calibrate camera expectations to "decent."
- **Genode / Sculpt** — a microkernel capability OS can be a daily driver on open phone hardware (PinePhone); on a closed flagship the driver wall remains the barrier. (Supports building on documented hardware first.)


<a id="mvp-ladder"></a>

## MVP Configuration Ladder (carried forward)

The spec defined cut-down configurations so value ships earlier; this ladder transfers, re-mapped to the demo brick and the fork:

| Config | Includes | Deferred |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MVP-A (product in emulation) | full product layer L6 + Starnix interop, in the Fuchsia emulator | all hardware |
| MVP-B0 (hardware alive) | kernel + display + input + Wi-Fi on the demo brick | GPU accel, modem, camera |
| MVP-B1 (with data) | + cellular data/SMS via the pre-certified module | voice, camera |
| MVP-B2 (with camera) | + basic photo (HDR+, before tuning polish) | flagship quality |
| Full | everything incl. voice and per-sensor tuning | — |

Pragmatic order: get MVP-A demonstrable first (product in emulation, zero hardware blockers), then MVP-B0 (a Wi-Fi "tablet" without telephony), and only then modem/camera. This is exactly the two-track lane structure of AOS-PLAN-018.

## Module Inventory by Status (reference)

The spec's full module map, re-expressed for the fork + demo brick. Kernel/userspace frameworks are FORK/AS-IS from Fuchsia; hardware is mostly AS-IS pre-certified modules (not REVERSE, unlike the Pixel-9 plan):

| Layer | Module | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L0 | Fuchsia tree | FORK |
| L0 | Zircon, DFv2, FIDL, Magma, Scenic/Flatland, Starnix | AS-IS |
| L1 | Board bring-up (demo brick: RP1/PiSP documented) | PORT |
| L1 | Power island (nRF/ESP32) | FROM-SCRATCH firmware |
| L2 | GPU/Magma driver | PORT |
| L3 | Cellular (pre-certified module) | AS-IS |
| L4 | Camera capture + libcamera | WRAP |
| L4 | HDR+/Halide | AS-IS |
| L4 | Sensor tuning | FROM-SCRATCH |
| L5 | Starnix compat | AS-IS |
| L6 | Shell, entity/agent, history, sync, integrations | FROM-SCRATCH |
