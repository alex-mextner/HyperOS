## Digest

The 60-page source specification explores a Fuchsia-based mobile OS on Pixel-class hardware, covering Zircon, Starnix, FIDL, Flatland, Pixel 9 bring-up, camera, modem, verified boot, backup, and agent integration. It is valuable as a subsystem inventory and risk list.

The project's central platform decision is unchanged: fork Fuchsia/Zircon. The system forks the entire Fuchsia tree and takes Zircon, DFv2, FIDL, Magma, Scenic/Flatland, and Starnix as-is, adding native Rust-first contracts, board drivers, and product layers on top. Fuchsia is the base, not merely prior art. Claims that Linux userspace components, Pixel camera algorithms, IMS, GPU drivers, Titan M2, or complete backup can be reused “as is” are converted into claims and experiments with legal and technical gates.

## Current Disposition

This digest is interpretive. Normative requirements are defined by the linked architecture, product, hardware, legal, and planning documents. Unverified statements become claim or experiment records rather than implementation assumptions.

## Traceability
